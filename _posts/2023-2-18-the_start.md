If you're reading this, you've found my first ever blog post! Welcome! If you'd like, stay awhile and listen.

# Welcome

I'm not entirely sure yet what I'm doing here, but with the Layoff-ageddon of 2023, I have a glut of free time to find out. Hopefully I can use this as an opportunity to talk about things I'm working on. This might just turn into yelling into the void, but at least then I have a record I can point to and say "Look, I've screamed about this before!" And, who knows! Maybe something here can be helpful to someone.
